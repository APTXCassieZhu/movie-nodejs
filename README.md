# 1. Objectives

• Get familiar with AJAX and JSON technologies
• Use a combination of HTML5, Bootstrap and Angular on client side
• Use Node.js on server side
• Get familiar with Bootstrap to enhance the user experience using responsive design
• Get hands-on experience of Cloud services hosting NodeJS/Express
• Learn to use popular APIs such as TMDB Api
# 2. Background
## 2.1 AJAX and JSON

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML) incorporates several technologies
• Standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS
• Result display and interaction using the Document Object Model (DOM)
• Data interchange and manipulation using JSON
• Asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest
• JavaScript binding everything together
## 2.2 Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating responsive websites and web applications. It
contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and
other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. To learn more details about
Bootstrap please refer to the lecture material on Responsive Web Design (RWD). You should use
Bootstrap 4 in this homework.

## 2.3 Cloud Services
## 2.3.1 Google App Engine (GAE)

Google App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your
traffic and data storage needs change. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain. You
simply upload your application and it’s ready to go. App Engine applications automatically scale
based on incoming traffic. Load balancing, micro services, authorization, SQL and noSQL
databases, memcache, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, roll out and roll backs, and
security scanning are all supported natively and are highly customizable.

## 2.4 Angular

Angular is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is
fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to
suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Angular combines declarative
templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve
development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the
web, mobile, or the desktop.
For this homework, Angular 8+ (Angular 8, 9 or 10) can be used, but Angular 10 is
recommended. Please note Angular 8+ will need familiarity with Typescript and componentbased programming.

## 2.5 Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an eventdriven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js package
ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Also, Express.js is strongly recommended. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web
application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is
in fact the standard server framework for Node.js.
